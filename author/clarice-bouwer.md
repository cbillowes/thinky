When I was 7 I remember watching a page being printed in colour with my older cousin. I asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up. She said a computer programmer and I promptly copied her answer. I became one.

I was always intrigued by computers and what they could do. When the internet became popular I was hanging out on IRC and Yahoo Chat groups and taking apart websites to learn HTML. In high school I focused more on web design and front end development. I remember struggling with making forms do cool stuff like send e-mails and save to databases so I decided to go to CTI (Computer Training Institute - a college) to learn just how to do that. After college I had design, front-end and back end skills which was so freaking cool for me.

I started my software development career in 2006. I have always used all my skills in my projects. Most of my career I was working alone or in really small teams of two with minimal dependencies.

In 2013 I started at a corporate which turned my world upside down. Working in a larger team with countless dependencies on technologies I have never even heard made me overwhelmed. Decisions are harder to make as there are more people involved. Processes need to be followed. Dependencies frustrated me.

All in all, this experience has enriched me. In one year, the journey that I have been on has meant more to me personally and professionally than any of my past experience. Don't get me wrong - I don't disregard my past experiences because without that I would not be who I am today but this journey has had a very powerful effect on me.

This led me to this blog. I want to contribute to the development community. I want to share my mistakes and frustrations. I want to show how my perspectives have changed from day to day. I want to encourage the community to ask more questions and find value in what they are doing. I want to learn from the community.

I hope you find value in what I have to share and encourage you to challenge me.

@cbillowes: Code for fun and to pay the bills. Favourite colour is #cc0000. No really, it is. Compulsive re-tweeter.
