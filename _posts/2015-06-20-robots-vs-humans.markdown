It’s not rocket science to quickly check the [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/) and [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) for a website but for everything, there is a Chrome Extension.

I use the [Robots vs Humans](http://blarg.co.uk/tools/robots-vs-humans) Chrome Extension offered by <em>wrakky<em> to quickly view the robots.txt and humans.txt for any website I browse to.  To add a bit of jovial flair, with a click of a button you can let the robots and humans fight it out for “ultimate supremacy”.

If you are interested in viewing the source code or forking the repository, it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wrakky/robots-vs-humans).
