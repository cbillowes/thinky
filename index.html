  <h1>Ask Why?</h1>
  <p>The only constant in software development is change.&nbsp;
    Companies are releasing new hardware and software at a phenomenal rate.&nbsp;
    Developers need to <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/20/constantly-changing-technologies/" target="_blank">stay on top of things</a> or risk out-dating their skills.&nbsp;
    We need to be self motivated and learn as much as we possibly can.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    When I start researching, I feel the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing" target="_blank">Socratic paradox</a>:&nbsp;
    “I know one thing: that I know nothing”. There is just so much to know even when specialising. When I look at unanswered questions on&nbsp;
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>, I feel overwhelmed and dumb.&nbsp;
    Regardless, I am excited that there is so much to learn in this industry.&nbsp;
    There is never a dull moment and I am always challenged.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    It is time for me to share my knowledge with my future self and others. The most important thing that I have learned is to ask why.&nbsp;
    That is the <a href="/2015/06/14/what-is-all-this-thinky-business/">premise</a> of the thinky website.</p>

  <p>I encourage you to ask why more often.</p>
