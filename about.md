The [premise](/blog/2015/06/14/what-is-all-this-thinky-business/) of this website is about the importance of asking questions. If you are working on a feature for a solution ask questions like:

- Why does this feature need to be built?
- What is its value to the business or user?
- Who is this feature for (target-audience)?
- Is this really the feature that you want or may I suggest this…?

This doesn’t only apply to features. It could be anything. Perhaps it takes you three weeks before you can deploy to production. In this case you should ask if the process is working? What is getting in your way? Are there any bottlenecks?

What about quality? Does your team deliver super clean, cutting edge code or is it just hacks that are delivered?

No team or project is perfect. Every team and project has its issues. If we just go with the motions, we will never improve. Asking questions if the first step to improvement.

> Thinky is a play on the word think and why and that is the story you should tell. ;)
