##SVG
DStv Digital Media is running a development boot camp with different missions. One of them included an HTML5 webpage that changed themes based on the time of the day. I thought this was a great opportunity for me to play with SVG.

I wanted to learn SVG so I started making my own vector images and created a page which showed the sun and clouds when viewed between 06:00 to 17:59 and a moon with pulsing stars when viewed between 18:00 to 05:59.

Feel free to [check it out](/playground/svg).
