##[Time of Day Challenge](/playground/svg)
DStv Digital Media is running a development boot camp with different missions. One of them included an HTML5 webpage that changed themes based on the time of the day. I thought this was a great opportunity for me to play with SVG.

I wanted to learn SVG so I started making my own vector images and created a page which showed the sun and clouds when viewed between during the day and a moon with pulsing stars when viewed between at night.
Feel free to [check it out](/playground/svg).


##[Hot Plate Challenge](https://github.com/cbillowes/play-hotplate)
I stumbled upon a coder challenge at [The Daily WTF](https://what.thedailywtf.com/t/hot-plate-challenge/48927) and decided to try it out for fun. I really like challenges like this that get you thinking outside of your production code paradigm. [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com) offers quite a lot of cool challenges like this.
[Check out](https://github.com/cbillowes/play-hotplate) my attempt at GitHub.
