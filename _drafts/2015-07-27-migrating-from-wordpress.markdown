#Migrating from WordPress

I have not been able to focus on this blog for the past few weeks but now that I am back I will be migrating from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I have chosen to do so for a few reasons but the main reason is for performance. WordPress is a great platform to get a website up and running in no time but as a developer I feel rather constrained by the “clunkyness” of all the plugins influencing my page speed and having to work around them is making me tired.

I chose Jekyll because it is a static site generator and so far it is working great for me. It also opens up learning opportunities for me to get into Ruby on Rails (after the fact). :)

Hopefully I will have something out soon so that I can start sharing more of my thoughts with you.

Until then... keep on asking questions.
